# Auth Template

## Overview

This project is a customizable **authentication template** created using **React**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Deno**. It is designed primarily for my own use as a reusable foundation for handling user login and registration across multiple future projects.

While this template is not intended to be a one-size-fits-all solution, it aims to cover the majority of the common authentication features I will need for personal projects, including user sign-up, login, and other related authentication functionalities.
